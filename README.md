# Cpp-Reflection-20

A modern, header-only C++20 reflection library providing compile-time introspection capabilities for types, members, and functions.

## 🎯 Features

- **C++20 Standard**: Leverages modern C++ features including concepts, constexpr, and structured bindings
- **Header-Only**: Easy integration without compilation overhead
- **Type Introspection**: Reflect on class members, methods, and properties at compile-time
- **Zero Runtime Overhead**: All reflection operations are resolved at compile-time when possible
- **No External Dependencies**: Pure C++20 standard library implementation

## 📋 Requirements

- C++20 compliant compiler:
  - GCC 10+ 
  - Clang 12+
  - MSVC 2019 16.10+
- CMake 3.15 or higher (for building examples and tests)

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit issues, fork the repository, and create pull requests.

### Development Guidelines

1. Maintain C++20 standard compliance
2. Ensure all code is constexpr where possible 
4. Update documentation accordingly
